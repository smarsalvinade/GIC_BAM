# GIC_BAM
Software to compute Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GIC) in power networks. Based on the Bus Admittance Matrix method (BAM).
Construction of a DC-equivalent network and GIC computation over time in a power network.
Input:
 - Real network parameters (line and grounding resistances, transformer types and winding resistances, substation locations, ...) conveniently arranged in input Excel file. Assumed constant in time.
 - Geoelectric field over time. It may be either homogeneous (constant in space) or heterogeneous (variable in space). If heterogeneous, the E field is given in a grid covering the power network area. The E field in the entire power network is interpolated from this grid.
      Note: Heterogeneous E-fields are assumed to have been generated by other means (e.g., from magnetic field and earth conductivity data).
Output:
 - Ig: GIC flow to earth in substation earthing over time,
 - Ilinph: GIC flow per phase in each transmission line over time.
 - Iwi: GIC flow in transformer windings (/phase) over time.
 - It: effective GIC flow in transformers (/phase) over time.
